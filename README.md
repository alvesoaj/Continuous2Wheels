## Continuous2Wheels v1.0 - A Library for Arduino

ATENTION: On MASTER branch has the code to use with Arduino's IDE >=1.0, if you are using any version of IDE below, use the branch called "bellow1.0" 

Continuous2Wheels is an Arduino's library to control the movements of robots guided by two wheels connected to `continuous servo motors`

For robots with DC Motors go to [DC2Wheels](http://github.com/zerokol/DC2Wheels)

### Instalation
Para modo de uso em Portugês: [Continuous2Wheels - Para robôs Arduino de duas rodas com servo motores 
](http://www.zerokol.com/2012/05/continuous2wheels-para-robos-de-duas.html)

For usage mode in English: [Continuous2Wheels - Continuous2Wheels - For two wheels servo motor Arduino Robots
](http://www.zerokol.com/2012/09/continuous2wheels-for-two-wheels.html)

Clone or [download](https://github.com/zerokol/Continuous2Wheels/downloads) this project to arduino's libraries folder:
on Ubuntu (/usr/share/arduino/libraries/) on Windows(Where you download the Arduino IDE, the folder is in )

Now is all ready, JUST:

Open your Arduino IDE
Go to SKETCH → IMPORT LIBRARY → Continuous2Wheels

### Usage

See at [c2w_wheel_controller.pde Example](http://github.com/zerokol/Continuous2Wheels/blob/master/examples/c2w_wheel_controller/c2w_wheel_controller.pde)

See advanced at [c2w_adv_wheel_controller.pde Example](http://github.com/zerokol/Continuous2Wheels/blob/master/examples/c2w_advanced_wheel_controller/c2w_adv_wheel_controller.pde)
